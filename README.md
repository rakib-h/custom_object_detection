# Train an Object Detection Classifier for Multiple Objects Using TensorFlow-API on Ubuntu
This repository is a tutorial for how to use TensorFlow's Object Detection API to train an object detection classifier for multiple objects on Ubuntu. It was originally written using TensorFlow version 1.5, but will also work for newer versions of TensorFlow. I careated a new dataset with 6 categories images(Book, Mug, Water Bottle, Cent, SmartPhone, Wallet) using my smartphone camera. After traing, I used my laptop's webcam for detections.

###### Sample Object: Book, Mug, Water Bottle, Cent, SmartPhone, Wallet

#### Requiremnts

- Protobuf 3.0.0
- Python-tk
- Pillow 1.0
- lxml
- tf Slim (which is included in the "tensorflow/models/research/" checkout)
- Matplotlib
- Tensorflow (>=1.12.0)
- Cython
- contextlib2
- ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco
